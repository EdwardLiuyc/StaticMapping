Velodyne 3D laser scan data
===========================

The velodyne point clouds are stored in the folder 'velodyne_points'. To
save space, all scans have been stored as Nx4 float matrix into a binary
file using the following code:

  stream = fopen (dst_file.c_str(),"wb");
  fwrite(data,sizeof(float),4*num,stream);
  fclose(stream);

Here, data contains 4*num values, where the first 3 values correspond to
x,y and z, and the last value is the reflectance information. All scans
are stored row-aligned, meaning that the first 4 values correspond to the
first measurement. Since each scan might potentially have a different
number of points, this must be determined from the file size when reading
the file, where 1e6 is a good enough upper bound on the number of values:

  // allocate 4 MB buffer (only ~130*4*4 KB are needed)
  int32_t num = 1000000;
  float *data = (float*)malloc(num*sizeof(float));

  // pointers
  float *px = data+0;
  float *py = data+1;
  float *pz = data+2;
  float *pr = data+3;

  // load point cloud
  FILE *stream;
  stream = fopen (currFilenameBinary.c_str(),"rb");
  num = fread(data,sizeof(float),num,stream)/4;
  for (int32_t i=0; i<num; i++) {
    point_cloud.points.push_back(tPoint(*px,*py,*pz,*pr));
    px+=4; py+=4; pz+=4; pr+=4;
  }
  fclose(stream);

x,y and y are stored in metric (m) Velodyne coordinates.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Note that the velodyne scanner takes depth measurements
continuously while rotating around its vertical axis (in contrast to the
cameras, which are triggered at a certain point in time). This means that when
computing point clouds you have to 'untwist' the points linearly with respect to
the velodyne scanner location at the beginning and the end of the 360Â° sweep.
The timestamps for the beginning and the end of the sweeps can be found in the
timestamps file. The velodyne rotates in counter-clockwise direction.

Of course this 'untwisting' only works for non-dynamic environments.
